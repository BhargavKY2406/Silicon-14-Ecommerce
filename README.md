Silicon-14 is a modern, fully-responsive e-commerce web application built with React.js. It features a sleek, premium user interface designed for tech enthusiasts to browse, filter, and purchase top-tier electronics.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Simulates a real-world backend by fetching product data asynchronously via a mock API (`fetch` and `useEffect`).
- **Advanced State Management**: Efficiently handles complex states like Shopping Cart, Wishlist, Product Filtering, and Sorting using React hooks.
- **Persistent Storage**: Utilizes `localStorage` to ensure user Cart and Wishlist data is saved across browser sessions.
- **Filtering & Sorting Engine**: Users can instantly search by product name, filter by specific brands (Apple, Samsung, Sony, etc.), and sort by price, rating, or name.
- **Premium UI/UX**: Features a highly aesthetic, responsive design with dark mode, interactive hover states, scroll-spy navigation, and smooth micro-animations.
- **Loading & Error States**: Professional handling of API lifecycles with custom loading spinners and fallback UI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 19 (via Vite)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS3 with Custom Properties (CSS Variables) for theming
- **Data Fetching**: Native Fetch API
- **State Management**: React `useState`, `useEffect`
- **Deployment**: Vercel
